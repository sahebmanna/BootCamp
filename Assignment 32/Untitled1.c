/*
2. Define a class Rectangle and overload area function for different types of data type.
3. Define a base class Animals having member function sound() . Define another
derived class from Animals class named Dogs. You need to override the sound
function of the base class in the derived class.
4. Define a class Addition that can add 2 or 3 numbers of different data types using
function overloading.
5. Define a class A having multiple constructors. Define another class B derived from
class A. Create derived class constructors and show use of constructor in this single
inheritance.
6. C++ Program to illustrate the use of Constructors in multilevel inheritance of your
choice.
7. C++ Program to illustrate the use of Constructors in single inheritance of your choice.
8. Write a C++ program to find the factorial of a number using copy constructor
9. Write a C++ program to calculate the area of triangle, rectangle and circle using
constructor overloading. The program should be menu driven.
10. Create a C++ class for player objects with the following attributes: player no., name,
number of matches and number of goals done in each match. The number of
matches varies for each player. Write a parameterized constructor which initializes
player no., name, number of subjects and creates an array for number of goals and
number of matches dynamically.*/
